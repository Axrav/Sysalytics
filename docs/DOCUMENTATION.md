| /                     | GET  | No                | Root endpoint, to check if API is up and running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| /currentProfile       | GET  | No                | Returns the current power profile being used. Requires `power-profiles-daemon` to be present.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| /currentSwappiness    | GET  | No                | Returns the swappiness of the Linux kernel being used. Swappiness is a property for the Linux kernel that changes the balance between swapping out runtime memory, as opposed to dropping pages from the system page cache. Swappiness can be set to values between 0 and 100, inclusive. A low value means the kernel will try to avoid swapping as much as possible where a higher value instead will make the kernel aggressively try to use swap space. |
| /currentBatteryStatus | GET  | No                | Returns a JSON with battery status [charging, not charging, discharging], current capacity, and the model number of the battery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
